## Pole of inaccessibility (PIA)

Function to find the [PIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_of_inaccessibility) from a given polygon and tolerance, following the quadtree approach by [Vladimir Agafonkin](https://github.com/mourner) described [here](https://github.com/mapbox/polylabel)

This is adapted from the approach in CartoDB's [crankshaft](https://github.com/CartoDB/crankshaft)
